## Simple Web Browser in Python
My Browser is a simple web browser created with Python and the tkinter library. It allows the user to enter a URL and navigate to webpages. The HTML source code of the webpage is fetched and displayed in the browser window.

## Features
GUI window for entering and displaying URLs
Ability to navigate to webpages using the URL field and Go button
Displays the HTML source code of the webpage in the browser window
Uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML and extract the content of the webpage
Handles errors that may occur when trying to fetch the HTML source code (e.g., if the URL is invalid or if there is no internet connection)
## Requirements
Python 3
tkinter library (should be included with Python)
urllib library (should be included with Python)
BeautifulSoup library (can be installed using pip install beautifulsoup4)
Running the browser
To run the browser, clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the browser.py file. Then run the following command:

```bash
  python3 browser.py
```



The browser window should appear, and you can enter a URL in the text field and click the "Go" button to navigate to the webpage. The HTML source code of the webpage will be fetched and displayed in the window.
